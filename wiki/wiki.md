## How to add $MELD to your wallet

Adding Melodity ($MELD) to your wallet is one of the most important things to do in order to actually be able to use, transfer and trade your funds.

Each wallet has its own protocol this is why we have chosen to provide only one wallet specific method to add Melodity to your wallet and a more generic way to do it.

All operations **must** be run under the Binance Smart Chain network (BSC).

#### Adding Melodity ($MELD) to Metamask

As Metamask is one of the most widespread wallets in Ethereum-compatible environments we've chosen to provide an easy and direct way to add Melodity to your wallet.

#### Adding Melodity ($MELD) to any wallet

All wallet providers offer the possibility to "_add custom tokens_", find that button and you'll be asked with a "_smart contract address_". In order to add Melodity to your wallet, all you have to do is to copy-paste the following address in that field.

**0x13E971De9181eeF7A4aEAEAA67552A6a4cc54f43**

If after a few seconds the other field does not automatically fill, insert:

* decimals: 18
* symbol: MELD
* name: Melodity
