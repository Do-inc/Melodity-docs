# How to use Melodity's lock explorer?

The melodity's lock explorer can be found at [https://lock.melodity.org/](https://lock.melodity.org).

### Melodity lock explorer composition

The page you'll find yourself on will be similar to the following one.

![Main melodity's lock explorer page](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

On this page we can identify a few elements, starting from the top left of the screen:

1.  Wallet address search bar: This search bar is identified by the "Wallet address" text, entering a wallet address here means looking for locks assigned to that wallet address.

    As Melodity native token lives on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the wallet address **must** be a Smart Chain address like the next one provided.

2. Explore button: This button is used to submit or refresh the lock research, it may not be necessary to press it at all as the research automatically starts once a valid wallet address is entered
3. Wallet connection button: This button is the green one on the top left of the page, by clicking on this button you'll get connected to your wallet (if one is installed in your browser), a wallet connection is required to redeem the funds assigned to a wallet
4. Activities section: The activities section stores the last event of the smart contract and shows the amount of Melodity still locked in the contract.

The next image will clarify any doubt about the elements we talked about.

### Examine wallet's locks

In order to examine the locks of a wallet address you only have to enter the wallet address on the search bar, for simplicity, we'll use the same address used in the previous example.

As we said once a valid wallet address is entered in the search bar the wallet search is automatically performed.

Particularly as the wallet we're examining is one of the developer team we see it only has four (4) locks that can be redeemed respectively on the 27-03-2023, on 21-03-2024, on 16-03-2025 and the last one on 11-03-2026.

### Redeeming one or more locks

{% hint style="info" %}
The examples of this section are all executed on the Binance Smart Chain Testnet, no funds or balances are real.
{% endhint %}

In order to redeem one or more locks, it is necessary to access the lock explorer with a wallet compatible browser, any modern desktop browser is compatible with Metamask and other wallets so nothing special. Mobile wallets usually have a browser functionality you can use to navigate websites requiring wallet authentication.

When one or more locks gets unlocked they'll be easily identifiable on the lock explorer as they have a slightly different colour, in the next image you can see that _on the testnet_ the developer's wallet has at least two locks that can be redeemed.

![Redeemable locks - BSC testnet](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

In order to redeem the locks, it is necessary to access the lock explorer using the same wallet having the redeemable locks. In order to access using your wallet simply click on the green wallet button on the top right of the page.

![Wallet connection button](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

Once you've connected your wallet the button will partially show your wallet address as a confirmation.

![Wallet connected](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Once your wallet gets connected a "Redeem" button will become visible.

Clicking on the "Redeem" button will let you sign and send the transaction and the funds will be immediately released to your wallet.

Redeemed locks will remain visible in the lock explorer for everyone.
