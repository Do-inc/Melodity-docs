# General questions

## What is DeFi?

DeFi is short for “decentralized finance,” an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain geared toward disrupting financial intermediaries.

DeFi draws inspiration from blockchain, the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, which allows several entities to hold a copy of a history of transactions, meaning it isn't controlled by a single, central source. That's important because centralized systems and human gatekeepers can limit the speed and sophistication of transactions while offering users less direct control over their money. DeFi is distinct because it expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial use cases.

## What is a token?

A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, composed of unchangeable, digitally signed data joined in packages called blocks. Each block is linked with the previous block, using a cryptographic signature. This allows blockchains to be used as an immutable source of truth, which can be publicly accessed and validated by anyone with the appropriate permissions.

Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that creates the backbone of a new type of internet since it overcomes the major challenges of internet which is security & trust hence known as the internet 2.0. It has no central authority, the very definition of democratized system. Therefore everything built on this platform is very transparent and everyone involved is accountable for their actions.
