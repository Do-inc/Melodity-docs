# Testnet validator incentives

## Which are testnet validators incentives?

The testnet must be taken and kept online but in order to do this, someone should maintain testnet nodes online.

Do inc. will permanently maintain two (2) testnet nodes online but at least 8 more slots should be filled so how can this be achieved?

Here come the testnet validators incentives, these incentives are given only to the first eight (8) node operators that join the testnet, all subsequent testnet node operators will not receive any incentive.

The incentive is given only for the first node of the testnet, running more than one node will not grant more incentives.

In order to be eligible for the incentives, the whole KYC defined [here](become-a-node-operator.md#kyc) **must** be completed.

#### The incentive for running and maintaining online for lifetime ONLY a testnet validator node

* Five thousand (5k) $MELD vested with the _Dev times_
* Five thousand (5k) $MELB available on mainnet when launched
* One thousand (1k) $MELB airdropped every year on mainnet when launched

#### The incentive for running and maintaining online for the lifetime a testnet validator node AND a mainnet validator node
